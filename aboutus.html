        <p>
          We are three friends who discovered a shared passion for anime and became even closer because of it. We all came from different backgrounds, but anime was the thread that connected us.
    While anime has always been a big part of our lives, it was the connection it fostered between us that truly ignited our desire to create this podcast. With each episode, we aim to celebrate anime in all its forms, from the well-known to the weird, and share our thoughts, laughs, and insights with fellow fans.
    
    We realized that anime had created a unique space for us to share, connect, and grow as friends. Now, we want to bring that energy to you!

             <div class="next-toeachother">
              <p> My name is Naybe, I am 20 years old full time student. I am a bookworm and love staying inside and doing indoor activities. I enjoy reading and watching movies and series of all types. Anime has been something I love watching often with friends or my sister.  for this podcast I am glad I can share and talk a little more abt the shows I enjoy. My favorite anime is 'A silent voice', I watched this movie a long time ago and I enjoyed the story I also related with the characters and it often watch it as my comfort movie. I related a lot to many characters and also recognize certain behaviors which made me think back to myself and it gave me a different perspective.</p>

              <h2>Chantelle</h2>
              <div class="next-toeachother">
              <p> My name is Chantelle, i am 23 years old and my hobbies are watching anime and baking!
                I am originally from Curacao but i moved to The Netherlands to continue my studies and follow my dream of one day opening up a bakery!
             I have so many favorite animes so having to choose just 1 is difficult but if i had to choose 1, i would choose Attack on Titan.
                It's one of my favorites due to its intense and emotional soundtrack, which enhances both the action and drama of the story. The plot evolves from a simple fight for survival into a complex exploration of freedom, power, and the consequences of war. The characters, like Eren, Mikasa, and Armin, experience significant growth, making their struggles and relationships deeply engaging. Additionally, the anime offers strong female characters that  are very respectfully presented and portrayed 
               Anime has profoundly shaped who I am, sparking my passion for illustration and animation. The captivating art styles and storytelling inspired me to start drawing more, leading me to apply for an animation program. Although I was denied, the experience taught me perseverance and deepened my love for creativity.</p>
